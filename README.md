Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which
the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to
storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.
Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in 1982 by
Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan.

This is a copy of this game in terminal mode, using the ncurses library.
